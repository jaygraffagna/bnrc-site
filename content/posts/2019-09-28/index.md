The project focus is to restore an area between the creek and bike path to a native praire landscape. It began June 2019 with efforts continuing through July.  Our committiees focus was to remove the invasive plants from the area.  It contained fully developed teasel plants on the Iowa Department of Natrual resources invasive species list.

###Dates: September 28th, 2019

###Location: Duck Creek  

###Focus: Stream Clean Up  

During the first phase of the project, our committee was focused on identifying the fully grown teasel plants and removing them from the area.  Removing the plant involve hand cutting and pulling the teasel.  Once the fully grown teasel plants were removed, we coordinated with the city for the proper disposal of the plant waste.

The project will continued over the spring and summers of 2020 and 2021.  Each year of removal will start depleting the amount seedlings dropped by the fully grown teasel plants.  It will allow for the native plants to continue to drop seedings and allow further growth of the native plants in the area.  By protecting the native and promoting the native plants, it will make the area more resilient to invasive to growing and will require less interfecing from the city and our committee.

The residents of Bettendorf will be able to see an area within the city be restore to a natural state.  It can be used as an education tool for residents about the importantance of removing invasive species and restoring praire area to their original state.
