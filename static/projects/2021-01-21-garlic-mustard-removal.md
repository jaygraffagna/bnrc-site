The removal of garlic mustard - an invasive plant species has been an ongoing project. For the last several years volunteers have worked on clearing larger, disconnected areas. Some years garlic mustard pulls were not held. This has allowed the garlic mustard to continue to spread.

### Location: Devil’s Glen Park, Hollow View Park

### Focus: Invasive Species Removal

The committee is now concentrating its efforts to reduce garlic mustard in the area between Devil’s Glen Park and Hollow View Park. The plan is to work in smaller, more confined areas and as the garlic mustard is controlled in theses areas, the work area will be expanded. This is a multiple year project.

The removal of any invasive species encourages and promotes the re-establishment of a more native and sustainable habitat. The project focus is to restore an area between the creek and bike path to a native prairie landscape. It began May 2019 with efforts continuing through July. Our committee's focus was to remove the invasive plants from the area.
